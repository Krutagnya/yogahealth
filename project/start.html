            Yoga is an ancient practice from India that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve overall well-being. The word "yoga" means to unite, symbolizing the connection between body, mind, and spirit. It helps increase flexibility,
            strength, and balance while reducing stress and promoting relaxation. Yoga is practiced worldwide and has many different styles, each offering unique benefits. </p> Yoga, originating in ancient India over 5,000 years ago, is a
        practice that unites body, mind, and spirit.The term "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word "yuj," meaning to unite. Early references are found in the Rigveda, with further development in the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras,
        compiled around 200 BCE, outline the eight limbs of yoga, including asanas and meditation. Hatha Yoga, focusing on physical postures, emerged in the medieval period. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Indian gurus like Swami Vivekananda popularised
        yoga globally. Today, yoga is celebrated worldwide for its holistic benefits and continues to evolve with contemporary interpretations and styles.</p>
        <p>Regular yoga practice fosters mental clarity and tranquillity, enhancing body awareness and alleviating chronic stress patterns. It induces relaxation, centres attention, and sharpens concentration. Yoga is an effective complementary therapy for
            treating anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders, promoting a profound sense of well-being, relaxation, and self-confidence. Practising yoga asanas builds strength and flexibility, benefiting muscles, joints, skin, glands, nerves, internal
            organs, bones, respiration, and the brain. Additionally, yoga supports better sleep and overall relaxation. By integrating breath control (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana), yoga fosters a deeper connection between the mind and body, leading
            to a balanced and harmonious life.
